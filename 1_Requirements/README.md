# Introdution
  A wiper is made up of a metal arm with one end pivoting and the other end having a long rubber blade attached. A motor, usually an electric motor, drives the arm, however pneumatic power is also utilised in some vehicles.
  
# Objectives
  The operational speed of a vehicle wiper is controlled by a wiper speed control mechanism based on rain conditions. To generate, the control system incorporates a rain sensor that detects rain conditions. The amplitude of an analogue signal depends on the detected rain conditions.

# Components and Requirements

# Software specifications

# Description
  
# Microcontroller STM32F407VG
  The STM32F407VG family is built around the high-performance Arm® Cortex®-M4 32-bit RISC CPU, which operates at up to 168 MHz. All Arm single-precision data-processing commands and data formats are supported by the Cortex-M4 core's Floating point unit (FPU) single precision.
  
# Working principle
  An electric motor drives the wipers on the windshield. The wiper arms are moved by an electric motor connected to a worm gear that provides the necessary force to a long rod. The worm gear can create the force needed to move the wipers at their maximum speed.

# What
  Windshield wipers are a minor component of your vehicle, but they have a significant impact on your driving and overall safety. At the touch of a button, they quickly and cleanly remove rain, snow, dirt, pollen, frost, and other material. Windshield wiper arms are moved across the windshield by the windshield wiper motor.
  
# When 
  When it starts to rain, the front of the automobile normally employs a wiper system that uses two blades at once and a parallel tandem system to move the two blades. When the wiper motor starts to come on, the crank arm rotates, causing the connecting rods to pull and push against each other.

# Why
  The wiper cleans the front and rear windshields of the car, albeit not all cars have wipers on the back side. WIper cleans the windshield by removing oil, dust, moisture, and grime that have become attached.
  
# Where
  A wiper drive and two wiper arms make up a windshield wiper system. The drive pushes the two wiper arms across the windshield at an angle that allows the driver and passenger to see clearly. A carefully contoured rubber wiping lip gives the best possible wipe.
